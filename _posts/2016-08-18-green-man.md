Several members of the lab helped with the conception and development of the Dynamic Cell installation for <a href="http://einsteinsgarden.net/einsteins-garden-presents-2016/">Einstein's Garden</a> at the <a href="http://www.greenman.net">Green Man Festival</a> this year. There was music, graphs of goo, puppeteers, and much more.
