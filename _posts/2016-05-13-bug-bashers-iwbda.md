A team of synthetic biology PhD students from the <a href="http://www.synbio-cdt.ac.uk">SynBioCDT</a> have been awarded funding to head to the <a href="http://www.iwbdaconf.org/2016/#bdathlon">BDAthlon</a> programming contest taking place in Newcastle this August.

The interdisciplinary "Bristol Bug Bashers" team consists of Daniel Dixon a biologist focused on analog computation in living cells, Vittorio Bartoli a chemical engineer implementing negative feedback controllers for use in metabolic engineering, and Jack Steventon a protein designer that uses molecular dynamic simulations to facilitate rational design. Both Daniel and Vittorio are performing short-projects in the lab this summer and we wish them all the best for the competition.
