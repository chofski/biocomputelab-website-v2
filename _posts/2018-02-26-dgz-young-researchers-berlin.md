Tom was invited to speak about his recent work on probing synthetic genetic circuits using RNA-seq at the DGZ Young Scientists' Forum in Berlin for the Bottom-up Synthetic Biology Track. 

This event is run by the German Society for Cell Biology and was held at the amazing [Berliner Medizinhistorisches Museum](http://www.bmm-charite.de/hoersaalruine.html). This venue has seen several Nobel Prise winners and has a collection of human specimens that are not for the faint-hearted! A huge congratulations must go to Sabine Reichel-Klingmann for organise such a successful event.
