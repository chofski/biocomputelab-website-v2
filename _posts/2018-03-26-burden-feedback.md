New paper just out in Nature Methods on the use of feedback control to regulate the burden that synthetic genetic circuits place on a host cell. Big thanks to Francesca Ceroni and the Ellis and Stan groups at Imperial who lead the work. Find out more [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4635).
