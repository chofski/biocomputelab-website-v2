Tom was honoured to take part in the first Dagstuhl Seminar on [Formal Methods for the Synthesis of Biomolecular Circuits (18082)](http://www.dagstuhl.de/18082) at the beautiful Schloss Dagstuhl in the Leibniz-Zentrum f√ºr Informatik, Wadern, Germany.

This invitation only event brought together researchers from computer science, physics, and bioengineering to explore how formal methods can be developed to more precisely describe complex biological functions and help in the automation of their design.
