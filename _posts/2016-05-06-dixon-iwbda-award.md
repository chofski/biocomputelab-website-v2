The [8th International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA)](http://www.iwbdaconf.org/2016/) will be held in Newcastle this year and Danny has been awarded a scholarship to attend and present his work! Daniel's research is focused on analog genetic circuits and uses a mix of modelling and experiments to help guide and potentially automate the creation of new biological devices.
