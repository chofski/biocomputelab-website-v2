Are you interested in programming and open-source development projects? Want to know what it is like to do some real research? Well, this year the [Biocompute Lab](http://www.biocomputelab.org) has joined the global [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) scheme that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source projects.

Our project will focus on improvements to a genetic circuit visualisation tool called DNAplotlib to enable beautiful renderings of complex biological designs and to support the development of the next-generation of visualisation pipeline. Successful students will be mentored by Thomas Gorochowski (University of Bristol, UK) and Bryan Bartley (University of Washington, USA). For more details about the scheme and how to apply check out the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) GSoC page: [http://www.nrnb.org/gsoc.html](http://www.nrnb.org/gsoc.html), and for specific information about our project check out: [DNAplotlib GSoC Project](https://github.com/nrnb/GoogleSummerOfCode/issues/74)
