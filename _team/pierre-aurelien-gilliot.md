Student at the EPSRC/BBSRC Synthetic Biology Centre for Doctoral Training with a background in Mathematics, Pierre is interested in applying modern statistical techniques to describe and design DNA sequences with bespoke properties. Like Jennifer Lawrence or Lambert Wilson, Pierre is a Leo with Sagittarius rising, meaning he's naturally enthusiastic and optimistic. When he's not in the lab, he can usually be found playing the violin, trying to replicate a Tasty recipe or sipping a pumpkin spice latte while reading some Beauvoir. Favourite quote is "Live Laugh Love".
