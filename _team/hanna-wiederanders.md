Focussing on the non-pathogenic bacterium Bacillus subtilis, I try to understand and control cellular movement by combining different regulatory components in genetic circuits. In this way, motility in response to specific environmental factors can be regulated and the way for potential medical applications of B. subtilis will be paved.
