I aim to apply engineering principles to better design living systems for use as biochemical factories. If designed right these cellular factories could convert waste into valuable products in a way that is both environmentally and economically sustainable. My research is highly inter-disciplinary, combining existing technologies from different fields to accelerate innovations in synthetic biology into real world applications.
