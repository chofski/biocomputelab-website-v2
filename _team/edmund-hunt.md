Complexity scientist with a long-standing interest in social behaviour. After a PhD focused on ant colony exploration and decision-making, he spent a year at UCLA working on social spiders, networks and animal personality. Working with Sabine Hauert in Engineering Mathematics, the goal is to understand and engineer swarm control across length scales (bacteria-ants-robots).
