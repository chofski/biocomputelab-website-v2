I am a Royal Society funded PhD student with a background in Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Technology with expertise in biochemistry, molecular and synthetic biology.
 
My aim is to investigate the use of a robust information storage medium, DNA, as a writable form of memory, and derive the underlying principles for successful construction of cellular monitoring devices with features leading to rapid switching and robust performance. The rational and predictable engineering of biological systems is a resource for the future scientific research, a weapon to revolutionise ways of thinking and of living with possible applications in a medical environment.

Currently, I am focusing on systematically constructing and measuring the function of cell memory registers and devices in simple hosts employing high-throughput assembly methods and sequencing technologies. In the future, one might think of controlling more complex cells or even whole organisms’ behaviors through cellular logic applied to many different recombinase-based memory registers, potentially resolving great plagues for humanity.
