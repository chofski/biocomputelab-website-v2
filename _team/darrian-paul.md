I am a Ph.D. Student in Biological Sciences at the University of Bristol with a background in Biotechnology. Currently, I am investigating the creation of genetic engineering tools to make genetic engineering cheaper and more accessible. My project is focused on exploiting photosynthesis in microalgae for synthetic biology and biotechnology applications.
