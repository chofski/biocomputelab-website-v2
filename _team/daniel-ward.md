I aim to push forward the use of computational tools and agent-based modelling approaches to close the gap between in vivo/vitro and in silico experiments. With recent technological advances in consumer processing power and GPUs it has become increasingly possible to create agent-based models that directly inform and replicate experiments previously reserved for the lab, allowing us to test a massive number of possible scenarios in an ever-shortening amount of time. My work is highly inter-disciplinary, combining research in systems and synthetic biology with computer science with the aim of designing an optimal framework to run these highly complex multiscale agent-based models.
